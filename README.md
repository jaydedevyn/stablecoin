# Stablecoin

Stablecoin is a decentralized application built using Solidity that enables the creation and management of stablecoins similar to Liquity (LQTY). The app leverages advanced techniques such as GasPools and PriceFeeds to ensure efficient and accurate management of stablecoins, while closely tracking the current price of the coin.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/jaydedevyn/stablecoin.git
```

Next, you will need to install the required packages. Please refer to the `README.md` file in the `client` and `server` directories for instructions on how to install these packages.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you will need to start both the client and server applications. Please refer to the `README.md` files in the `client` and `server` directories for instructions on how to do this.

Once both the client and server applications are running, you can open the client application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Using the Application

When you first open the application, you will see the main interface for creating and managing stablecoins. You can create a new stablecoin by specifying the desired amount and collateral type. The app will then generate the appropriate amount of stablecoins and store them in your account.

Once you have created a stablecoin, you can manage it by tracking its price and making adjustments as necessary. The app leverages advanced GasPool and PriceFeed techniques to ensure that your stablecoin remains stable and accurate, while closely tracking the current price of the coin.

## Conclusion

Stablecoin is a powerful tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts looking to create and manage their own stablecoins. The app's advanced techniques and intuitive interface make it easy to create and manage stablecoins, while ensuring accuracy and stability over time. With its Solidity-based architecture, Stablecoin is a cutting-edge tool that is sure to be popular with cryptocurrency traders and enthusiasts alike.
